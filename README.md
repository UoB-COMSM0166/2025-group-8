## Think-Aloud Usability Test Report
Game: MechDog vs. Drone Platformer
Participant: 1 student (adjacent group)
Tasks:
Complete Level 1 from the main menu.
Attempt to return to the main menu mid-level.
Key Observations
Collision Detection Issues
Participant encountered "invisible walls" near platforms, causing confusion and frustration ("Why am I bouncing off nothing here?").
Missing Return Functionality
No option to exit mid-level; participant tried ESC/UI buttons unsuccessfully ("Do I have to close the game?").
Oversized Obstacles
Large obstacles trapped the player ("This rock is way too big—I’m stuck!"), forcing respawns.
Repetitive Level Design
Levels 1 and 2 felt identical except for backgrounds ("Where’s the challenge?"), with no mechanical or enemy variation.
Unlimited Respawns
Infinite retries reduced stakes ("No stakes—boring!"); no game-over system observed.
Predictable Enemy AI
Drones followed simple, easily avoidable paths ("Too easy to dodge").
Critical Issues
Urgent Fixes: Broken collision detection and lack of pause/return menu disrupt core usability.
Design Weaknesses: Repetitive levels, oversized obstacles, and trivial enemy behavior lower engagement.
Missing Systems: No difficulty scaling or fail states harm replayability.
Recommendations
Priority Fixes:
Repair collision detection.
Add a pause/return menu.
Gameplay Enhancements:
Resize obstacles; add dynamic elements (e.g., moving platforms).
Introduce tiered difficulty and unique enemy behaviors (e.g., ambushes, patrol patterns).
Progression Systems:
Implement a game-over state and limited lives.
Differentiate levels with new mechanics (e.g., environmental hazards, boss fights).
Next Steps: Address collision/UI issues first, then expand level complexity and enemy AI.
