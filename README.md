## Two Prototype Ideas

1: Super Mario
Super Mario is a hallmark in platform game design, featuring meticulously crafted levels that progressively challenge players' skills. The game excels in tight, responsive controls and a physics engine that enhances predictable gameplay. Central to its appeal are the power-up system and varied enemy interactions, which diversify strategies and increase engagement. Super Mario also integrates puzzle elements and cooperative multiplayer, expanding its gameplay beyond traditional platforming to include adventure and teamwork dynamics.

2. Merge Big Watermelon 
Merge Big Watermelon is a casual puzzle game known for its simple and engaging mechanics. Players merge similar items on a grid to create larger ones, aiming to form the biggest watermelon. The game features a minimalistic, colorful design and is developed with technologies that ensure it works across multiple platforms. It's easy to play but offers increasing challenges

Lecturer User Story: Teaching Game Development with P5.js
Title: Curriculum Development for Introductory Game Design using P5.js

As a lecturer in game design,
I want to develop a course module focused on using P5.js for creating simple games,
So that students can learn basic programming concepts and game mechanics in an accessible, hands-on manner.
Acceptance Criteria:

The course should introduce P5.js and its functionalities related to game development.
Students will complete small projects, like creating individual game elements (platforms, characters, obstacles).
The module includes practical coding exercises that lead to the creation of a complete small game by the end of the course.
Course materials must provide links to online resources and communities for continued learning and support.
These user stories are designed to focus on the core aspects of building a simple platform game using P5.js, making sure that the development process is manageable and educational for those involved, including students learning game development.

## reflection

During the development of our platform jumping game, our team deepened our understanding of agile development practices, focusing on epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
Epics helped us frame the major goals of our project, dividing our focus between engaging gameplay and robust technical performance. This division ensured a balanced approach to both user experience and system functionality.
User stories enabled us to see the game through the players' eyes, driving us to prioritize features that directly enhance user engagement and satisfaction, such as customizable characters and multilingual support. Each story clearly outlined specific user needs, guiding our design and development efforts.
Acceptance criteria were essential in defining the specific conditions for completing user stories, facilitating precise testing and quality control. This specificity helped prevent scope creep, keeping our team aligned on the definition of feature completion.
The context of creating an accessible and enjoyable game influenced every aspect of our project, from planning to implementation, ensuring we addressed the diverse needs of our player base and optimized the game for various devices.
This experience not only improved our product's alignment with user expectations but also refined our project management skills, emphasizing the importance of clear, user-focused, and detailed planning in software development.
