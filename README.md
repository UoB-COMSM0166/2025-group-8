## Two Prototype Ideas

- **Super Mario:** 

Super Mario is a hallmark in platform game design, featuring meticulously crafted levels that progressively challenge players' skills. The game excels in tight, responsive controls and a physics engine that enhances predictable gameplay. Central to its appeal are the power-up system and varied enemy interactions, which diversify strategies and increase engagement. Super Mario also integrates puzzle elements and cooperative multiplayer, expanding its gameplay beyond traditional platforming to include adventure and teamwork dynamics.

- **Merge Big Watermelon:** 
Merge Big Watermelon is a casual puzzle game known for its simple and engaging mechanics. Players merge similar items on a grid to create larger ones, aiming to form the biggest watermelon. The game features a minimalistic, colorful design and is developed with technologies that ensure it works across multiple platforms. It's easy to play but offers increasing challenges

## Epics & User Stories
| Stakeholder            | Epic                                        | User Story                                  | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Players**            | **Player Experience Enhancement**           | As a player, I want the game to offer at least three difficulty settings: Easy, Medium, and Hard, so that I can enjoy the game at a pace suitable for my skill level. | Given the game's settings menu, when I select a difficulty setting, then the game's speed and obstacle density should adjust accordingly. |
| **Players**            | **Player Experience Enhancement**           | As a player, I want a system of achievements and rewards for completing levels without failing, collecting all items, or achieving high scores, so that I feel recognized for my accomplishments and stay engaged with the game. | Given I meet specific game milestones, when these conditions are met, then rewards such as new character skins or special abilities should be unlocked. |
| **Game Developers**    | **Developer Efficiency and Collaboration**  | As a game developer, I want to use a game development platform that integrates with popular version control systems and supports automated testing tools, so that I can implement features quickly and with fewer bugs. | Given the development platform, when I deploy new code, then it should seamlessly integrate with version control and trigger automated tests. |
| **Game Developers**    | **Developer Efficiency and Collaboration**  | As a game developer, I want tools that support real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to edit the same files without conflicts, so that the team can work together seamlessly regardless of location. | Given a collaborative coding session, when multiple developers make changes, then all changes should be visible in real-time without conflicts. |
| **Graphic Designers**  | **Visual and Audio Immersion**              | As a graphic designer, I want access to a comprehensive library of creative assets that are suitable for platform games and customizable in terms of color and size, so that I can design unique and appealing game visuals efficiently. | Given the design phase, when I access the asset library, then I should find a wide range of pre-made and customizable graphics. |
| **Graphic Designers**  | **Visual and Audio Immersion**              | As a graphic designer, I want the game engine to support high-resolution graphics up to 4K without performance degradation, so that the game looks crisp and engaging on all devices. | Given any supported device, when the game is played, then it should display high-resolution graphics scalable without loss of detail. |
| **Sound Engineers**    | **Visual and Audio Immersion**              | As a sound engineer, I want a dynamic sound system that adjusts sounds based on the game's speed and player movements, so that the audio is immersive and enhances the game experience. | Given any gameplay session, when the player's speed or actions change, then sound effects and background music should dynamically adjust in pitch or volume. |
| **Sound Engineers**    | **Visual and Audio Immersion**              | As a sound engineer, I want an efficient system for managing and testing audio clips within the game, including tools for editing and tagging, so that I can ensure the audio quality is consistent throughout the game. | Given the sound editing tools, when I modify audio clips, then the changes should be easily testable and categorizable within the development environment. |
| **Marketing Team**     | **Effective Player Engagement and Marketing** | As a marketing team member, I want to conduct targeted marketing campaigns using player data to segment audiences effectively, so that we can reach the right audience and maximize engagement. | Given player demographic and preference data, when I segment this data for a campaign, then the marketing tools should allow for targeted promotions. |
| **Marketing Team**     | **Effective Player Engagement and Marketing** | As a marketing team member, I want the game to have social media integration, allowing players to connect their accounts and share achievements, so that gameplay achievements can organically drive traffic and downloads. | Given the social media feature, when a player achieves a milestone and chooses to share it, then the share should include a link to the gameâ€™s download page. |
| **Game Reviewers and Bloggers** | **Enhancing Game Visibility and Credibility** | As a game reviewer or blogger, I want early access to game builds and detailed release notes at least one month before the official launch, so that I can review and provide informed feedback, helping to build anticipation and inform potential players. | Given early access, when I review the game and communicate feedback, then it should be considered for improvements before launch. |
| **Game Reviewers and Bloggers** | **Enhancing Game Visibility and Credibility** | As a game reviewer or blogger, I want exclusive access to interviews with the development team and behind-the-scenes content, so that I can create engaging content that provides deeper insights into the game development process. | Given access to the development team, when I conduct interviews or receive content, then it should be detailed and suitable for direct embedding in posts. |





## Reflection

During the development of our platform jumping game, our team deepened our understanding of agile development practices, focusing on epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
Epics helped us frame the major goals of our project, dividing our focus between engaging gameplay and robust technical performance. This division ensured a balanced approach to both user experience and system functionality.
User stories enabled us to see the game through the players' eyes, driving us to prioritize features that directly enhance user engagement and satisfaction, such as customizable characters and multilingual support. Each story clearly outlined specific user needs, guiding our design and development efforts.
Acceptance criteria were essential in defining the specific conditions for completing user stories, facilitating precise testing and quality control. This specificity helped prevent scope creep, keeping our team aligned on the definition of feature completion.
The context of creating an accessible and enjoyable game influenced every aspect of our project, from planning to implementation, ensuring we addressed the diverse needs of our player base and optimized the game for various devices.
This experience not only improved our product's alignment with user expectations but also refined our project management skills, emphasizing the importance of clear, user-focused, and detailed planning in software development.
