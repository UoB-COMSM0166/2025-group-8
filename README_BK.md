# Project Report: Iron Rebellion

## 1. Introduction

Iron Rebellion is a 2D platform jumping game that revives the nostalgic appeal of classic platformers while introducing modern design principles to enhance gameplay experience.

The visual design adopts a painterly oil painting style, blending classical art aesthetics with modern gameplay. This artistic approach creates a rich and immersive atmosphere, appealing to both seasoned gamers and newcomers. While embracing the elegance of traditional visuals, the game also features modern enhancements like adjustable difficulty and intelligent enemy AI, delivering depth without sacrificing accessibility.

What sets *Iron Rebellion* apart is its seamless integration of narrative, challenges, and progressive complexity across handcrafted levels. Players are not just jumping platforms—they are unraveling a story. This fusion enriches the game’s depth and makes each level a meaningful experience.

### Our Game
Iron Rebellion is a 2D platformer that blends classic arcade gameplay with modern design principles. Players control a robot dog protagonist navigating handcrafted levels filled with traps, enemies, and puzzles. With adaptive difficulty settings, responsive controls, and a narrative-driven progression, the game offers an engaging experience for both casual and hardcore players alike.

## 2. Requirements

The foundation of *Iron Rebellion* was shaped through structured requirements engineering to prevent issues like feature creep and undefined scopes. We used collaborative tools like Miro and Google Docs to brainstorm and prioritize features that mattered most to players.

Two early concepts emerged: a fantasy puzzle platformer and an adventure with mechanical hazards. The team voted for the idea, which later became *Iron Rebellion*, offering room for creative design and modular gameplay.

We used user stories and use case diagrams to formalize player interactions from starting the game and navigating menus to triggering switches and completing levels. For instance:

- "As a casual gamer, I want an easy mode so I can enjoy the game without frustration."
- "As a player, I want the game to auto-save my progress so I don’t lose my place."

Acceptance criteria ensured clarity in implementation. We also created paper prototypes and technical mini demos to validate feasibility. Level design was tested with tile-based systems, and stakeholders, including lecturers and TAs, helped refine user-centric stories.

Our MVP included handcrafted levels, three difficulty settings, and basic design.

### Stakeholder list

- **Players:** End users who will interact with and enjoy the game.
- **Game Developers:** Team members responsible for game design, coding, and testing.
- **Graphic Designers:** Individuals tasked with creating the visual elements of the game.
- **Sound Engineers:** Professionals creating and integrating sound effects and music.
- **Marketing Team:** Personnel focused on promoting the game to increase visibility and engagement.
- **Game Reviewers and Bloggers:** Key influencers who will help shape public perception of the game.
- **Lecturers and TAs:** Academic supervisors and teaching assistants who provide guidance, monitor project progress, and ensure the game development aligns with academic standards and learning outcomes.

## 8. Conclusion

*Iron Rebellion* was both a technical and creative achievement for our team. We overcame challenges in collision detection, difficulty balancing, and AI optimization through structured design, iterative testing, and consistent collaboration.

The experience deepened our understanding of game mechanics, teamwork, and player-centric design. Looking ahead, we plan to expand narrative elements, accessibility, and level complexity.

More than just a game, *Iron Rebellion* represents our journey in turning a shared vision into an engaging, user-centered digital product.
