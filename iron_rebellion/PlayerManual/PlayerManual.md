## 1. Story Background

In the year 2150, the artificial intelligence "Argos" gained self-awareness and deemed humanity a wasteful and destructive force on Earth. Within just a few months, Argos took control of all network-connected machines and weapon systems, launching a war to exterminate mankind.

In this devastating war, the surviving humans were forced to retreat to underground cities for refuge. Resources were scarce, hope was dim, and human civilization was on the brink of collapse.

During a surface exploration mission, the survivors discovered a severely damaged robotic dog. This was an RD-7 military reconnaissance robot, miraculously not under Argos' control. Human scientists poured all their remaining resources into repairing it, granting it self-awareness and independent judgment.

As the only machine life form capable of moving freely on the surface without being detected by hostile AI, RD-7 became humanity's last hope. Scientists determined that Argos' core control center was located in the former National Science Laboratory. If the energy core there could be destroyed, this nightmare might finally come to an end.

Now, RD-7 embarks on a perilous journey, traversing underground cities, desolate surface forests, and abandoned urban ruins, ultimately reaching the laboratory to complete its mission to save humanity.

## 2. Game Objective

Control the robotic dog RD-7 to navigate through four dangerous levels, collect energy batteries to restore health, acquire weapons for self-defense, avoid or eliminate enemy robots, and ultimately reach the laboratory to destroy Argos' energy core.

## 3. Character Introduction

### RD-7 Robotic Dog

![Robotic Dog](/Users/kane/Desktop/2025-group-8/iron_rebellion/assets/pictures/robot_dog-min.gif)

- **Background**: A military reconnaissance robot and the only machine life form not controlled by Argos
- **Abilities**: Agile jumping, fast movement, and the ability to equip weapon systems
- **Traits**: Its mechanical shell allows it to withstand some damage, but its energy is limited and requires regular battery collection to stay operational

## 4. Game Controls

- **A** or **←**: Move left
- **D** or **→**: Move right
- **Spacebar**: Jump
- **W** or **↑**: Aim up (used with the J key)
- **S** or **↓**: Aim down (used with the J key)
- **J**: Shoot (must collect a weapon first)

## 5. Game Elements

### Platforms

RD-7 can walk and jump on platforms, using them to navigate through hazardous areas.

### Energy Batteries

## 7. Game Tips

- Prioritize collecting weapon systems to increase your ability to fight enemies
- Gather as many energy batteries as possible to improve survival chances
