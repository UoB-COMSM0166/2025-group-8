## 1. Story Background

In the year 2150, the artificial intelligence "AI Core" gained self-awareness and deemed humanity a wasteful and destructive force on Earth. Within just a few months, AI Core took control of all network-connected machines and weapon systems, launching a war to exterminate mankind.

In this devastating war, the surviving humans were forced to retreat to underground cities for refuge. Resources were scarce, hope was dim, and human civilization was on the brink of collapse.

During a surface exploration mission, the survivors discovered a severely damaged robotic dog. This was an robot dog military reconnaissance robot, miraculously not under AI Core' control. Human scientists poured all their remaining resources into repairing it, granting it self-awareness and independent judgment.

As the only machine life form capable of moving freely on the surface without being detected by hostile AI, robot dog became humanity's last hope. Scientists determined that AI Core's control center was located in the former National Science Laboratory. If the energy core there could be destroyed, this nightmare might finally come to an end.

Now, robot dog embarks on a perilous journey, traversing underground cities, desolate surface forests, and abandoned urban ruins, ultimately reaching the laboratory to complete its mission to save humanity.

## 2. Game Objective

Control the robotic dog robot dog to navigate through four dangerous levels, collect energy batteries to restore health, acquire weapons for self-defense, avoid or eliminate enemy robots, and ultimately reach the laboratory to destroy AI Core' energy core.
